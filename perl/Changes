Revision history for Config-Neat

1.303   Pending release
        - Provide better error reporting on infinite @inherit loop errors

1.302   May 25, 2017
        - Fix rendering of '0'
        - Properly render empty default values as ``

1.301   March 2, 2017
        - Fix test data initialization code and update test data itself
          to reflect changes introduced in 1.3

1.3     February 28, 2017
        - Fix issue #4 (Incorrect handling of LIST items with inheritance).
          Note that with this fix the internal raw representation of the
          arrays in the config data has changed, but the API masks that
          change and stays the same; applying a schema to a config also
          ensures that the resulting data structure is correct

        - Fix issue #5 (Validator will now die on bogus boolean values;
          previously it would only warn and continue)

1.204   October 4, 2015
        - Add `to_ixhash_recursive` helper function to Config::Neat::Util

1.203   August 5, 2015
        - Add missing 'JSON' dependency (used in `dump-nconf`)

1.202   August 5, 2015
        - Add missing test files to the distribution

1.201   August 5, 2015
        - Get rid of File::Slurp::Tiny in favor of simple read_file function

1.2     August 5, 2015

        - Fixed properly check for unmatched closing bracket, add corresponding test
        - Added check and test case for missing closing bracket
        - Fixed some warnings, mute 'unitialized' warnings where appropriate
        - Fixed parsing of multi-line comments in this form:  /** / ... /**/

1.101   October 26, 2014

        - Bugfix: store 'converted to array' flags in a context-aware stack

1.1     October 26, 2014

        - Fixed and simplified parsing for repeating nodes

        - More parsing tests; use subtests for better structuring

1.0     October 25, 2014

        - Added the support for 'LIST' schema type
          to always cast single or multiple entries with the
          same name to an array (list) of nested items

        - Replace File::Slurp with File::Slurp::Tiny
          (as per https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=95680)

        - is_any_hash, is_any_array convenience functions
          in Config::Neat::Util

0.9     May 11, 2014

        - Implemented proper cascaded inheritance

0.8     May 10, 2014

        - Fix inheriting the same local paths from different files
          (save the file name as a part of the cache item key)

0.7     April 11, 2014

        - Automatically convert merged node to an IxHash
          if necessary

        - Allow casting any hash to an array

        - Support rendering default hash values

        - Do not count the key length for the hash keys
          that don't have values

0.6     March 12, 2014

        - Add the minimal version requirement for Test::More (0.94)

        - Must clone node before putting it into the cache;
          added test for multiple node reuse

0.5     March 4, 2014

        - Report a proper error when trying to render objects
          of unsupported types

        - Tests no longer have any hardcoded paths in the
          reference data

0.4     March 2, 2014

        - A more correct schema-based automatic casting
          from HASH to ARRAY (+ additional test)

        - Add File::Slurp to the list of build prerequisites

0.3     February 28, 2014

        - By default, hashes are now merged (no need to set '+'
          prefix for the merged key); arrays, on the contrary,
          are replaced by default, so '+' is needed to merge
          their values

        - When merging nodes, the original order of the keys
          is preserved

        - Support for hashes with mixed explicitly set and
          automatically generated indexed keys; hashes
          with sequential numbering can be cast to ARRAY
          automatically using Config::Neat::Schema

        * Initial CPAN release *

0.2     February 23, 2014

        - Support multiple key declarations at the same level
          (these will be converted to an array).

        - Support installation via Module::Build
